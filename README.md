# icosohedral-map
Convert a map to an icosohedral layout, commonly used in  sci-fi rpgs.

Horrible brute force method, but I couldn't find a tool to do this (things like G.Projector don't do this layout not could I find something existing to do the job simply (there's Flexify 2 - but it's both commerical itself and required photoshop - it is much better and does a lot more of course).

Documentation is in icoso.py, along with all the code.

Requires PIL and python 2.7+.

Unlikely to be of use to anyone, but maybe someone sometime will be doing the same come up with nothing search as me and stumble upon it.
